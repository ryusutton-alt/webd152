    <p>My favorite beverage is the Ultra Blue Hawaiian Monster energy drink because it gives me the kick I need to start the day. Between classes, assignments, and trying to stay on top of everything, caffeine has pretty much become a survival tool for me. The tropical flavor is refreshing and not too sweet, which makes it easy to drink first thing in the morning. It wakes me up, helps me stay focused, and keeps me from crashing during long study sessions. Honestly, I don’t think I’d get through most days without that extra boost of energy</p>
